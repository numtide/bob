//! Language-backend abstraction.
//!
//! bob's core (drv parser, graph, cache, path rewriter, worker pool,
//! scheduler, `.attrs.{json,sh}` emission, `genericBuild` replay) is
//! language-agnostic. A `Backend` supplies the per-language policy:
//!
//! - which drvs in the closure are "units" we replay (vs boundary inputs we
//!   `nix-store --realise`),
//! - how to map a user-supplied target name to a `bob.nix` attr path,
//! - which workspace units to track for source changes,
//! - what to inject into `builder.sh` after `source $stdenv/setup`
//!   (incremental-cache env vars, compiler wrappers, …),
//! - whether/how mid-build pipelining applies.
//!
//! The fd-3 `__META_READY__` signal itself is generic: any backend's wrapper
//! may emit it, and the scheduler will unblock dependents whose edge to the
//! emitter is classified as pipelineable. Backends without an early-artifact
//! analogue (Go) simply return `pipeline() == None` and every edge is
//! done-gated.
